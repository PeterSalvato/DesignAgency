body-text                      /* 16px content */

/* Components */
btn-primary, btn-secondary     /* Button styles */
card, card-hover              /* Card layouts */
```

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

- **Claude Code** installed and configured
- **Node.js** 18+ for integration script
- **Host project** with `conventions.md` and `symbol-index.md` files (recommended for optimal integration)

## 🔗 Host Project Integration

The AI Development Agency automatically adapts to your existing project through an intelligent methodology discovery workflow:

### **Methodology Discovery Workflow**
1. **Search for existing methodology**: Checks for `conventions.md` and `symbol-index.md` in root, docs/, .github/, etc.
2. **Prompt for location**: If not found, asks user if methodology files exist elsewhere
3. **Analyze and create**: If files don't exist, offers to analyze your project and create them
4. **Adapt to standards**: All specialists use discovered/created methodology for project-aligned recommendations

### **Quick Setup**
```bash
# Automatic methodology discovery and setup
/setup-project-methodology

# Force create new methodology from project analysis
/setup-project-methodology --force-create
```

**Result**: All 27 specialists understand and follow your project's specific conventions, architectural patterns, and quality standards.

## 🔄 Keeping Updated

# Get latest improvements
cd PortableAgency
git pull origin main
npm run integrate  # Re-apply latest changes
```
