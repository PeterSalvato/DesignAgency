## System Overview

### **The Problem We're Solving**

The original AI Development Agency had fundamental issues:
- **Manual Integration**: Required complex setup scripts and user technical knowledge
- **False Success Claims**: Claude claimed specialists were working without verification
- **Monolithic Design**: All 30 specialists loaded regardless of project needs
- **Poor Adaptability**: No mechanism to adjust specialist team to project evolution

### **The Solution: Self-Discovering Modular Agency**

A three-tier pack system that:
1. **Automatically discovers** when cloned into projects
2. **Dynamically constructs** technology-specific specialist teams
3. **Evolves intelligently** as projects change
4. **Verifies functionality** before claiming success
5. **Manages changes safely** with rollbacks and validation

---

## Architectural Principles

### **1. Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with essential specialists (base pack)
- Add technology-specific specialists automatically
- Allow domain-specific specialists by choice
- Scale complexity with project sophistication

### **2. Dynamic Intelligence**
- Technology detection drives specialist selection
- Real-world tech combinations (React+Node.js, not predefined stacks)
- Stack pack construction based on actual project analysis
- Evolution based on detected project changes

### **3. User Agency**
- Technology packs: Auto-suggested (Claude can detect React)
- Initiative packs: User-selected (Claude can't detect "e-commerce intent")
- Change management: User-controlled with intelligent guidance
- Override capabilities: Users can modify any auto-decisions

### **4. Enterprise Safety**
- Validation before any changes
- Impact analysis for major modifications
- Rollback capabilities with multiple restore points
- Staged deployment for complex changes

### **5. Verification-First**
- No false success claims
- Multi-level testing (specialist response, command availability, project integration)
- Continuous monitoring and health checks
- Honest status reporting with degraded functionality acknowledgment

---

### **Tier 2: Dynamic Tech Stack Pack (Technology Foundation)**

**Purpose**: Technology-specific specialists based on detected project stack

**Size**: Variable (5-15 specialists depending on stack complexity)

**Construction Logic**:
1. **Project Analysis**: Scan package.json, config files, directory structure
2. **Technology Detection**: Identify frameworks, databases, cloud providers, tools
3. **Specialist Mapping**: Map detected technologies to relevant specialists
4. **Integration Analysis**: Add cross-technology integration specialists
5. **Pack Generation**: Create custom tech stack pack with appropriate commands

**Example Constructions**:
```
React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + AWS:
├── react-architect          # React patterns and performance
├── nodejs-architect         # Node.js architecture and security
├── postgres-architect       # PostgreSQL optimization
├── aws-architect           # AWS deployment and services
├── fullstack-integration   # React-Node integration patterns
└── cloud-deployment        # AWS-Docker deployment workflows
= 6 specialists, 12 stack-specific commands

.NET + SQL Server + Azure + Entity Framework:
├── dotnet-architect        # .NET patterns and performance
├── aspnet-specialist       # ASP.NET Core optimization
├── entityframework-specialist # EF Core and database patterns
├── sqlserver-architect     # SQL Server optimization

├── enterprise-integration  # Enterprise patterns and compliance
└── microsoft-ecosystem     # Cross-Microsoft-tool workflows
= 7 specialists, 15 enterprise commands
```

**Evolution Rules**:
- **Additive Changes**: Adding Redis → Add redis-specialist automatically
- **Substitution Changes**: PostgreSQL → MongoDB → Replace relevant specialists with user confirmation
- **Major Changes**: Monolith → Microservices → Suggest architectural specialists with impact analysis

**Loading**: Auto-constructed and loaded during initial discovery, evolves with project changes

---

## Technology Detection

### **Detection Triggers**

1. **Initial Discovery**: When agency is first loaded into project
2. **File System Changes**: package.json modifications, new config files, directory changes
3. **Periodic Scans**: Weekly light scans, monthly deep analysis
4. **User Initiated**: Manual rescans, technology hints, explicit additions

### **Detection Patterns**

```json
{
  "frontend_detection": {
    "react": {
      "indicators": ["package.json:react", "*.jsx", "*.tsx", "next.config.js"],
      "confidence_thresholds": {
        "high": 0.9,
        "medium": 0.7,
        "low": 0.5
      },
      "framework_variants": {
        "nextjs": ["next.config.js", "pages/", "app/"],
        "gatsby": ["gatsby-config.js", "gatsby-node.js"],
        "create-react-app": ["public/", "src/index.js"]
      }
    }
  },
  "backend_detection": {
    "nodejs": {
      "indicators": ["package.json:express", "server.js", "index.js"],
      "framework_variants": {
        "express": ["package.json:express"],
        "fastify": ["package.json:fastify"],
        "nestjs": ["package.json:@nestjs/core"]
      }
    }
  },
  "database_detection": {
    "postgresql": {
      "indicators": ["package.json:pg", "*.sql", "prisma/schema.prisma"],
      "orm_variants": {
        "prisma": ["prisma/schema.prisma"],
        "typeorm": ["package.json:typeorm"],
        "sequelize": ["package.json:sequelize"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Stack Construction Algorithm**

```javascript
function constructTechStackPack(detectedTechnologies) {
  const specialists = new Set();
  const commands = new Set();

  // Core specialists for each detected technology
  detectedTechnologies.forEach(tech => {
    const coreSpecialists = getCoreSpecialists(tech);
    coreSpecialists.forEach(specialist => specialists.add(specialist));
  });

  // Framework-specific specialists
  const frameworks = detectFrameworks(detectedTechnologies);
  frameworks.forEach(framework => {
    const frameworkSpecialists = getFrameworkSpecialists(framework);
    frameworkSpecialists.forEach(specialist => specialists.add(specialist));
  });

  // Cross-technology integration specialists
  const integrationSpecialists = generateIntegrationSpecialists(detectedTechnologies);
  integrationSpecialists.forEach(specialist => specialists.add(specialist));

  // Technology-specific commands
  const techCommands = generateTechnologyCommands(detectedTechnologies);
  techCommands.forEach(command => commands.add(command));

  return {
    name: generateStackPackName(detectedTechnologies),
    specialists: Array.from(specialists),
    commands: Array.from(commands),
    integrations: generateIntegrationMatrix(detectedTechnologies)
  };
}
```
