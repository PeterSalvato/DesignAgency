# /cyber-pentest Command

## Usage
```bash
/cyber-pentest <target> [--scope=web|api|infrastructure] [--methodology=owasp|ptes|nist]
```

## Implementation
This command MUST invoke the cybersecurity-specialist agent using the Task tool:

```javascript
// Real Claude Code slash command implementation
export async function execute(args) {
  const result = await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Cybersecurity penetration testing",
    prompt: `You are the cybersecurity-specialist from departments/cybersecurity/agents/cybersecurity-specialist.md.

**IMPORTANT: This is for authorized security testing only. Verify authorization before proceeding.**

Target: ${args.target}
Scope: ${args.scope || 'web'}
Methodology: ${args.methodology || 'owasp'}

Perform comprehensive penetration testing as defined in your agent file:

1. **Pre-engagement & Authorization**
   - Verify testing authorization and scope
   - Document legal permissions and boundaries
   - Establish communication protocols

2. **Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**
   - Passive information gathering (OSINT)
   - Active reconnaissance and enumeration
   - Technology stack identification

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - OWASP Top 10 testing
   - Business logic flaw identification
   - Authentication and authorization testing
   - Input validation and injection testing

4. **Exploitation & Impact Analysis**
   - Proof-of-concept exploit development
   - Privilege escalation testing
   - Data access simulation
   - Impact assessment and risk rating

5. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Lateral movement simulation
   - Persistence testing
   - Data exfiltration simulation
   - Evidence collection

6. **Reporting & Remediation**
   - Executive summary with business impact
   - Technical findings with exploitation details
   - Prioritized remediation roadmap
   - Compliance gap analysis

Provide specific, actionable security recommendations with examples.
Focus on real-world attack scenarios and business impact assessment.`
  });

  return result;
}
```

## Expected Output
- Pre-engagement authorization verification
- Comprehensive security assessment report
- Detailed vulnerability findings with exploitation proof-of-concepts
- Prioritized remediation roadmap
- Executive summary with business impact analysis
