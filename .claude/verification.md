# Specialist Invocation Verification

## How to Verify Real Specialist Calls

### 1. Look for Task Tool Usage
Real specialist calls will show:
```
ðŸ”§ Using Task tool to invoke specialist...
ðŸ“Š Specialist analysis complete...
```

### 2. Check Specialist Identity
Responses must reference their department file:
```
"As the design-reviewer specialist from departments/design/agents/design-reviewer.md..."
```

### 3. Validate Specialized Output
- Design reviewer: Screenshots + pixel measurements
- Security engineer: OWASP compliance report
- Performance engineer: Lighthouse scores + optimization
- React architect: Component analysis + refactoring examples
